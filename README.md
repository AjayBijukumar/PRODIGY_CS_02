This is my second internship task at Prodigy InfoTech. I had to create a very simple image encryption tool by pixel manipulation. I used basic mathematical operations to be applied at each pixel. Users can provide an encryption key for encrypting as well as decrypting the image. But because of its simplicity, encryption can be easily done but the decryption causes loss of quality of image. The decrypted image will not be same as the original one.
